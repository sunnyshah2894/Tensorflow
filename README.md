## Tensorflow

TensorFlow is an open-source software library for dataflow programming across a range of tasks. It is a symbolic math library, and is also used for machine learning applications such as neural networks.

I had always wondered on how would one write the entire code to build his own mathematical model from scratch. From what I learned about tensorflow, it allows machine learning researcher to experiment with deep neural nets more easily. Tensorflow makes it easier for us to build the neural network, test the model with the high-performant native code it is build on and easily deploy the model on clouds. 

## Keras

Another framework build on top of Tensorflow, making it easier for us to build complex models. 

## Tensorboard

With the help of the frameworks like tensorboard, one can easily visualize the network built, look at the graphical visualization of the trained network, etc.
